# Question
When would be a good time to use an array instead of an object, and vice versa? Please provide examples.

# Answer
        A good time would be when you have an specific items you want named. Objects have keys and within the keys we can store values.
        
        Any example would be a people list. Within this list, we want to include age, name, hobbies, pets etc. An object would be best because we can find the value by "person.age" instead of an array not being able to tell us the difference.

You answered this question backwards and gave an example of when would be a good time to use an object instead of an array!!!! Everything you said here however is correct!
