Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer
    JSON is JavaScript Object Notation. It is a data representation format, and it is used widely across the internet. The example below is not JSON because the key is not surrounded by "".
